Hi everyone! My name is Jonathan Infante but I go by Jon, no h! I've been playing soccer ever since I could stand on my two feet and started my first job working as a referee in my spare time. I grew up in a big tech family so I naturally drifted towards programming over the years, intrigued by all the things you could do with it. I grew up on the coast in a city called Charleston, in South Carolina. However, its been my dream to move to a big city and take my life in any other direction possible! Hope to learn a lot with you all in this training.
